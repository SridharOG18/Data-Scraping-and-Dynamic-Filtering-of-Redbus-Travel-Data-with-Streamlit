# **Data Scraping and Dynamic Filtering of Redbus Travel Data with Streamlit**

## **Project Overview**
This project, titled **"Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering Application,"** leverages web scraping and data visualization to transform bus travel data for improved analysis and decision-making in the transportation sector. By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of key information from Redbus (e.g., bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability) and makes it available in a user-friendly format through a Streamlit web application. The aim is to enhance the efficiency of operational planning and provide valuable insights to stakeholders within the transportation industry.

## **Industry Domain**
- **Transportation**: Tailored for travel data analytics in public transportation, this project provides insights crucial for route planning and operational efficiency.

## **Key Skills**
- **Python Scripting**
- **Web Scraping with Selenium**
- **Data Management with SQL**
- **Streamlit Web App Development**

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.9**
- **MySQL 8.0**
- **Streamlit**
- **Selenium**

## **Application Features**

### **1. Automated Bus Information Retrieval**
Using Selenium, this project automatically collects and processes data from Redbus. The tool interacts with the Redbus platform by handling web elements like input fields and buttons, dynamically waiting for pages to load, and systematically extracting information such as bus departure and arrival times, ticket prices, and seat availability.

### **2. Database Management**
Collected data is stored in a MySQL database after being formatted in pandas DataFrames for easy analysis. Tables and schemas were specifically designed to support efficient querying, with the database fully accessible for management and retrieval purposes.

### **3. Interactive Web App with Streamlit**
The projectâ€™s Streamlit application acts as a simplified, interactive Redbus interface where users can search for bus routes, view available options, and filter results based on their requirements. Streamlit makes it easy to present data in a clean and intuitive interface that enhances the user experience.

## **Packages and Libraries Used**
- **Data Processing**: `pandas`, `datetime`
- **Database Connectivity**: `mysql.connector`
- **User Interface**: `streamlit`, `streamlit_option_menu`
- **Web Scraping**: `selenium`, `time`

This project demonstrates practical expertise in web scraping, data storage, and application deployment for real-time data access, offering powerful capabilities in the area of data-driven transportation analysis.
